# Introduction
This project was created and by my group for my Digital Computation class. This game will consists of a physical Robot that we built playing against a user.
We have programmed the EV3 Mindstorms Robot to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The EV3 faces off against a human player on the physical board using red and green tiles instead of x’s and o’s. The board, with some tiles in place, is shown below.
